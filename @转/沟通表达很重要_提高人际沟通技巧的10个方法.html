Communication is just as basic as food and drink.
沟通对于人类来说就像吃喝一样是最基本的需要。
While some people sail ahead using their impeccable communication skills, others struggle to be understood. Here’s how you can improve your communication skills.
当一些人熟练地运用完美的沟通技巧时，另一些人还在努力学习。下面是一些可以帮助你提高沟通技能的方法。
</p>
<ul class="this">
<li>
<h2>理解沟通的细微差别<span>Understand the Nuances of Communication</span></h2>
<p>沟通早已不再局限于口头的交流，而变成人与人之间联系的有效方式。沟通过程中存在着许多干扰和扭曲信息传递的因素，在传达的过程中信息的内容和含义经常会被误解。理解了这种微妙的差别，会使你更加意识到自我提高的需要。
<span>Communication has long transcended verbal exchanges to become an effective way of connecting with people. Communication leaves ample scope for misinterpretation, leaving greater chunks of the intended meaning lost in translation. Understanding such subtle nuances brings about greater awareness in self-improvement.
</span></p>
</li> 
 <li>
<h2>说出你的想法<span>Say what’s On Your Mind</span></h2>
<p>当信息被传达时，大多数人会因为怕达不到社会的期望值而羞于表达他们的想法。 人们常常在谈话中倾向于保留自己的想法。有效的沟通的最主要的目的就是能在特定的环境中表达出自己的想法。
<span>When it comes to conveying the desired message, most people shy away from speaking their mind mostly because they are bogged down by social expectations. They keep personal opinions withdrawn from the ensuing conversation. The prime purpose of being able to communicate effectively is to be able to express your personal opinions in the given matter.
</span></p>
</li> 
<li>
<h2>保持眼神的交流<span>Retain Eye Contact</span></h2>
<p>每一个谈话者都认为，吸引听众的完美方式就是与其保持眼神的交流。谈话时看着对方的眼睛，往往会将其摇摆不定的注意力吸引到交谈中。如果你想提高你的沟通技巧，想吸引住你的听众的注意力，记得说话时直视他的眼睛。眼神的交流能使谈话者的注意力无形之中集中起来。如果没有眼神的交流，言语交际甚至是完全无用的。
<span>Every conversationalist believes that the perfect way to engage audiences is to maintain eye contact with them. Looking at people in the eye tends to draw their wavering attentions to the conversation at hand. If you want to improve your communication skills remember to engage your audiences by directly looking at them. Eye contact ties the speaker to the masses with an invisible tether and forces them to pay attention. Without eye contact verbal communication is rendered completely futile.
</span></p>
</li> 
  <li>
<h2>肢体语言也很重要<span>Mind Your Body Language</span></h2>
<p>肢体语言的表达本身并不需要口头语言。它可以通过个人的特殊动作习惯、表情和肢体行为来完成沟通。有效的沟通需要口头交流与肢体语言的完美配合，从而在听众身上达到惊人的效果。要传达给定的信息，丰富的姿势、生动的表情加上肢体语言是极好的传达途径。面无表情的表达只会导致听众的厌倦，反之多变的表情会得到很好的效果。想提高自己的交际技巧，你应该多观察别人的说话方式。多和自己对话，对着镜子练习自己的肢体语言，找出自己的缺点并加以改正。
<span>The body does not need a verbal language to express itself. It can communicate via mannerisms, expressions and physical conduct. When it comes to effective communication skills, excellent verbal content is coupled with sound physical expression to render an engaging effect on the audiences. Animated gestures, lively expressions and physical mannerisms are excellent ways of conveying a given idea. A deadpan expression only conveys a lacklustre attitude and boredom, whereas an animated front is more engaging to witness. If you want to improve your communication skills, you should start observing others while they speak. Talk to yourself and check your body language in the mirror to ascertain your flaws and improve upon them.
</span></p>

<h2>善于倾听<span>Be A Good Listener</span></h2>
<p>沟通不是单向的过程。倾听与说话一样重要。事实上，大多数交际专家都认为，理想的沟通者听要比说的多。倾诉能缓解人际关系的烦恼，这听起来令人振奋，但有时候仅仅倾听就能获得成功。它不仅能丰富你的交际经验，还能让你在其他人身上获得更多的共鸣。
<span>Communication is hardly a one-way process. Listening is as important as speaking. In fact, most communication experts believe that an ideal communicator tends to listen more than speak. While it is heartening to be able to alleviate interpersonal troubles by talking it out, sometimes listening alone does the trick. Not only does it make the communicating experience richer but also makes you more sympathetic to the other person.
</span></p>
</li> 
<li>
<h2>口齿清晰<span>Clear Enunciation</span></h2>
<p>一些人的发音总是使倾听者很费解。在沟通中这是非常重要的，我们应加以重视。清晰的发音会使信息的传达更加有效。这不仅需要深入了解口语发音，更需要努力改善语音缺陷。
<span>Some people tend to draw their syllables out making their speech complete incomprehensible to the listener. While the idea of communication is extremely important, one shouldn’t treat the medium of communication lightly Crisp enunciation adds to effective delivery 。Not only do these require a thorough understanding of the spoken word, but also require much work on improving speech defects.
</span></p>
</li>

<h2>发音标准<span>Crisp Pronunciation</span></h2>
<p>演讲时，演讲者必须发音标准才能达到预期的效果。很多时候，因为糟糕的发音，即使演讲家也会遭遇听众的笑场。错误的发音往往会因此而造成所要传达的信息被曲解。如果你的发音需要改进，不要羞于寻求帮助。我们需要纠正我们的发音以保证沟通的有效性。
<span>When it comes to addressing an audience, a communicator must have an impeccable pronunciation to have the desired effect. Very often, bad pronunciation has made laughing stocks out of the most able speakers. The method by which the medium carries the message tends to shape the overall meaning accordingly .If your pronunciation needs improvement, don’t be shy asking for help. One should correct their pronunciation in order to maintain their effectiveness as good communicators.
</span></p>
</li>
 <li>
<h2>增加你的词汇量<span>Enhance Your Vocabulary</span></h2>
<p>沟通的技巧包括时时更新你的词汇量。很多时候在公众场合由于用词不当，最后只有直面尴尬。这正如盖房子不打好地基只会导致房屋的倒塌。学习新的词汇是提高你沟通技巧的宝贵方法。它不仅能提高你的口头表达能力，还可以帮助你更好的交流。一气呵成的叙述能帮助你成功的表达自己的想法，并有效吸引倾听者的注意力。
<span>Thorough knowledge of the medium involves equipping your vocabulary with new words. Many-a-times people have ended up using high-sounding words inappropriately only to face public embarrassment. Building a fortress without a strong foundation will only result in eventual failure. Learning new words is an invaluable addition to your communication skills. Not only does it increase your verbal prowess, it also helps you communicate better. Coherent language is an assured winner in registering the intended meaning and engaging audiences effectively.
</span></p>
</li>

<h2>其他有效的沟通方式<span>Follow Other Efficient Communicators</span></h2>
<p>人类是优秀的竞争者。我们在生活中与他人竞争，并在这个过程中学习新事物。要提高我们的交际技巧，最好的途径是向别人学习。只有通过观察他人你才有机会学到一些有用的东西。观察其他的谈话者会使你学到别人的优点。寻找具有良好沟通能力的同伴并密切观察他们。模仿他们的说话方式和习惯。随着时间的推移，你不但能像他们一样擅长交际，而且还能形成自己的独特风格。

<span>Human beings are excellent emulatorsWe live our lives emulating others and learn new things in the process. When it comes to picking up ideas for improving one’s communication skills, the best approach is to learn from others. It is only by observing others can you hope to pick up some helpful pointers for yourself. Observing other speakers will help inculcate their good points into your repertoire .Seek the company of good communicators and observe them closely. Emulate their speaking styles and mannerisms. With time, not only will you be able to communicate like them, but you will be able to develop your own distinctive style.
