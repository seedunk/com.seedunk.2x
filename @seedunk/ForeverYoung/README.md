Forever together, forever together...<br>
<br>
Forever together<br>
Forever love and fun until the morning sun<br>
Forever...<br>
<br>
Come on baby light my fire ready for the show<br>
Now I feel your love desire, please don't ever go<br>
Crazy dance and sexy power all I need is you<br>
Tonight I'll take you higher if you love me to<br>
<br>
All the time I need your shining smile<br>
Tonight I'm really going to play you know<br>
That life is just a game<br>
<br>
Forever young we are born to run<br>
Forever love and fun until the morning sun<br>
Forever young we are all for one<br>
Forever love and fun until the morning sun<br>
Forever...<br>
<br>
Come on baby let your body pump into the groove<br>
Shake your boogie feel the music jumping like a fool<br>
I don't care I'm so excited now I feel so free<br>
Paradise into your eyes so let it be<br>
<br>
All the time I need your shining smile<br>
Tonight I'm really going to play you know<br>
That life is just a game<br>
<br>
Forever young we are born to run<br>
Forever love and fun until the morning sun<br>
Forever young we are all for one<br>
Forever love and fun until the morning sun<br>
Forever together, forever together...<br>
<br>
